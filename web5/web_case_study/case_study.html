        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p id="paragraph">
          Mecanergie wanted to update and streamline its current website for
          various reasons. Firstly, the current website has certain information
          which is outdated and inaccurate, including the fact that Mecanergie
          works on oil heating systems, which is no longer the case. The website
          also contains links to social media platforms (Facebook and Twitter)
          which the company does not have and are therefore irrelevant. In
          addition, Mecanergie feels that its current website is too distracting
          for its clientele, including the light grey color of the website’s
          text which makes it more difficult to read. The vast majority of
          Mecanergie’s new customers are already familiar with the services that
          they provide given that they are referred through existing clients and
          are not people who find them online. As a result, Mecanergie wanted a
          more concise website with a brief description of its services that is
          easier to read and navigate. Mecanergie believes that a more modern
          and simpler web layout will attract new and existing clients and
          provide a more professional appearance.

          and air-conditioning service company that attracts the attention of

          is easy to read and navigate.

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p id="paragraph">
          The main challenge for this website was the design process which I
          needed to streamline from their current website which is not properly
          aligned and is too distracting for the nature of their business and
          clientele. The new website had to have a consistent design and be
          user-friendly, easy to navigate and responsive on a mobile and desktop
          computer. The design process took me five weeks to complete as I
          needed to come up with a sketch design and choose colors that are
          appropriate for the website. I had to make sure that I had all of the
          necessary elements for the new website including the text, logo, links
          and images, some of which, apart from the logo, I wanted to update in
          accordance with the current services that Mecanergie provides.

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p id="paragraph">
          My solution to overcome the challenges of Mecanergie’s current website
          was to create a more streamlined, simpler and concise website which is
          easier to navigate for its users. I researched various websites of
          companies in the plumbing, heating and air-conditioning industry which
          were modern, simple and user friendly. In simplifying the website, I
          wanted to incorporate sections including the home page, “About Us”
          which contains a concise list of services provided and a contact page.
          Since all client service calls are placed with Mecanergie by
          telephone, I wanted to highlight Mecanergie’s phone number in large
          bold numbers centered on the website as opposed to its current
          location on the top right-hand corner of the home page. Overall, I
          wanted to create a minimalistic design that is easy to read and
          navigate and does not provide clutter in terms of appearance and
          information.

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p id="paragraph">
          I was in contact with Mecanergie’s team throughout the entire design
          process. We chose to use the colors of Mecanergie’s logo in the
          website which are red, black and blue. I chose black lettering for the
          wording in the website which is a nice contrast from the current light
          grey lettering which is more difficult to read. In order to highlight
          Mecanergie’s phone number which is crucial to its business as it is
          how service calls are placed, I included Mecanergie’s phone number in
          large red bold numbers centered on the website with the words “Call
          Now” above. This is immediately noticeable by all. I also removed
          outdated information from the website including heating services which
          are no longer provided and removed any links to social media platforms
          which Mecanergie does not have. I streamlined the website and provided
          a link to a concise description of the services provided by Mecanergie
          in the plumbing, heating and air- conditioning sectors. Overall, I
          created a website that is streamlined, concise and easy to read and
          navigate.

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p id="paragraph">
          Mecanergie was pleased with the outcome of the website including the
          content and design layout. They were impressed by the size, color and
          location of their phone number which I centered on the website in
          large bold red numbers with the heading “Call Now” above. Mecanergie’s
          phone number is crucial to their business as it is how clients contact
          them and now it is front and center when going on the website. They
          also liked that I included a contact page where clients can request
          additional information by email. The Mecanergie team was pleased that
          I provided a link to and description of their services in the
          plumbing, heating and air- conditioning sectors. They also found the
          current text which I changed to a bolder black from the previous light
          grey, easier to read and more appealing. They appreciated that I
          incorporated the blue, black and red colors of their logo in the
          website. Overall, they liked the more streamlined, bolder and concise
          website which is easy to read and navigate for their current and new
          clients.
